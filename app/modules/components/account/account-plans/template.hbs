			<li>
				<h4>What is the difference between the Starter and the Professional plan?</h4>
				<p>The Professional plan is for people that are creating multiple websites that needed more customizability. On
					the Professional plan you are given access to more features, such as unbranded code, unbranded form
					notification
					emails, and the ability to transfer sites to other Webflow users. Our Starter plan allows anyone to create
					unlimited, unlocked hosted sites, even if you aren't on a Professional subscription.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What is the difference between a hosted and an unhosted site?</h4>
				<p>A hosted site mean it has a hosting subscription attached to it, which will unlock site features, and give
					you
					the ability to attach a custom domain. It comes with a lot of amazing benefits like CDN and security as
					well.</p>
